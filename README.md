# BARR-SYSTEM
BARR-SYSTEM is a multi-layered service package that assists knee injury patients throughout their rehabilitation process. A patient is now able to wear a 3D motion tracking knee strap to monitor their technique and performance while performing take-home exercises. Exercise results can be accessed in real time on a desktop patient portal, which displays performance in ituitive graphics and issues alerts if the system detects false technique of the patient. Such assistance improves recovery efficiency while also reducing the risk of recursive injuries and the amount of visits needed to therapists.
